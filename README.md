# Insect Navigation Sinusoidal Optimality

A sinusoidal activity profile in a circulant ring network doing path or heading integration has some nice properties - it is noise resistant and self-stabilising with a Hebbian learning rule.

## Noise Resilience

### Multiple harmonic encodings

* [What does it look like to encode with multiple harmonics at once](encoding%20with%20multiple%20harmonics.ipynb) - Figure 1

## Comparison to experimental data

## Oja's rule can develop the network weights
