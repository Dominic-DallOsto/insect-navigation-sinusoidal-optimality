# Insect Navigation Sinusoidal Optimality

A sinusoidal activity profile in a circulant ring network doing path or heading integration has some nice properties - it is noise resistant and self-stabilising with a Hebbian learning rule.

This code performs the analysis and figure generation for the paper ["Theoretical principles explain the structure of the insect head direction circuit"](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.91533) or see preprint [here](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.05.547838)
