# Sinusoidal Optimality Paper

Idea: Show that the a sinusoidal activity profile in a circulant ring network has some nice properties - noise resistant and self-stabilising with a Hebbian learning rule.

## Noise Resilience

### Non-negative activity

* [Noise resilience of using fewer Fourier modes](sinusoidal%20noise%20rejection.ipynb)
* [Trying the same with a spiking network](sinusoidal%20noise%20rejection%20spiking.ipynb)

### Zero mean activity

* [Noise resilience of using fewer Fourier modes](sinusoidal%20noise%20rejection%20negative%20activity.ipynb) - Figure 1

## Hebbian learning

* [Hebbian learning causes the weights to converge to a stable sinusoidal profile](sinusoidal%20activity%20Hebbian%20learning%20weights.ipynb)
* [Phase portraits for the activity and the weights](phase%20portaits.ipynb)
* [Updating both the activity and weights simultaneously](sinusoidal%20updating%20activity%20and%20weights.ipynb)

### Zero mean activity
